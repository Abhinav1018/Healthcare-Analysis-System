# Healthcare-Analysis-System


<p>
Hey! I have developed an Healthcare Analysis System which consists of the following for Stroke and Diabetes diseases:
<ul>
<li>Data Preprocessing</li>
<li>Data Exploration</li>
<li>Important Visualizations and Inferences</li>
<li>Prediction of disease using different ML algorithms </li>
<li>Graphical comparison of accuracy and performance of ML prediction models</li>
</ul>

In this project, firstly data is imported and studied to be able to process and explore various fields and factors and then analysis and visualization is performed to know and study the diseases. <br>

### STROKE ANALYSIS
<p>Stroke happens when a blockage or bleed of the blood vessels either interrupts or reduces the supply of blood to the brain.
Stroke is a leading cause of disability and death in the United States.According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths. A stroke, sometimes called a brain attack, occurs when something blocks blood supply to part of the brain or when a blood vessel in the brain bursts. In either case, parts of the brain become damaged or die. A stroke can cause lasting brain damage, long-term disability, or even death.</p>

As seen in the confusion matrix, the model has a high Specificity (99.6%), correctly predicting patients without stroke, but has a Sensitivity (correctly predicting stroke) of 60.4%. The original dataset has a very high class imbalance, so an oversampling technique was used.<br><br>

### DIABETES ANALYSIS

Comparison of Model Performance and Accuracy 
<img src = "https://github.com/Abhinav1018/Online-Recharge-System/blob/main/images/ss19.PNG"><br><br>
The model with the best accuracy is Random Forest with an accuracy of 81.81% <br>

<img src = "https://github.com/Abhinav1018/Online-Recharge-System/blob/main/images/ss20.PNG"><br><br>
As seen in the confusion matrix, the model has a high Specificity (68%), correctly predicting patients without diabetes, but has a Sensitivity (correctly predicting diabetes) of 93.5%<br>
